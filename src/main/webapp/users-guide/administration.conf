h1. Administration

Karaf provides some commands to administer multiple instances.  An instance of Karaf is a copy that you can launch separately and deploy applications onto.  An instance does not contain a full copy of Karaf, but only a copy of the configuration files and {{data}} folder which contains all runtime informations, logs and temporary files.

|| Commands     || Description ||
|  change-port   | Changes the port of an existing container instance. |
|  connect       | Connects to an existing container instance. |
|  create        | Creates a new container instance. |
|  destroy       | Destroys an existing container instance. |
|  list          | List all existing container instances. |
|  start         | Starts an existing container instance. |
|  stop          | Stops an existing container instance. |

Those commands are also available from outside the OSGi environment using the {{admin}}/{{admin.bat}} script in the {{bin}} folder.
